Project Description
Dataset Generation for YOLOv8 Training

This project is focused on generating synthetic datasets for training the YOLOv8 object detection model. The generated dataset consists of various shapes (circle, square, rectangle, triangle, star, and diamond) in different colors, each with corresponding annotations in the YOLOv8 format.

Key Features:

Synthetic Dataset Generation: Generates 2000 images with random shapes and colors, as well as labels in YOLOv8 format.

Color Range with Jitter: Each shape is filled with a color that can vary within a predefined range, making the dataset more realistic.

Customizable Configuration:

Supports multiple color choices including red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, black, and white.

Option to set background color (either black or white).

Adjustable parameters such as image size, number of images, and dataset split ratio (training and validation sets).

YOLOv8-Compatible Format: The dataset is generated in a structure suitable for YOLOv8 object detection training, including annotations that match YOLOv8's required format.

How It Works:

Images: Images are randomly generated by drawing shapes (circle, square, rectangle, triangle, star, and diamond) with different colors on either a white or black background.

Annotations: Each shape is annotated with its respective bounding box (in YOLO format), including its class ID and normalized coordinates for the center and size of the bounding box.

Splitting: The dataset is split into training and validation sets based on the specified ratio (e.g., 80% train, 20% validation).

Installation Instructions:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/dataset-generation-yolov8.git
cd dataset-generation-yolov8


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the script to generate the dataset:

python generate_dataset.py


The generated images and annotations will be stored in the dataset directory, organized into train and val subdirectories.

Directory Structure:

dataset/: Contains the generated images and labels.

images/train/: Training images.

images/val/: Validation images.

labels/train/: Training annotations in YOLOv8 format.

labels/val/: Validation annotations in YOLOv8 format.

txt/: Contains the classes.txt file which lists all the class names.

Usage:

You can use the generated dataset with any YOLOv8 implementation for training object detection models.

The annotations are in the standard YOLO format, making them compatible with most popular object detection frameworks.

Example Usage in YOLOv8:


Notes:

You can modify the number of images, image size, and color range in the script to tailor the dataset to your needs.

For better results in training, it's advised to use a higher number of images.
